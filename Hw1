#What surprised me was the amount of data we're able to put together to find results, but some things confused me like how do we account for the 366235 people who wrote N/A when asked what asked about birthsex, how does this effect the data as there are only two variable? Does it make it any less reliable or representative?
#Another thing that surprised me was the use of routine doctor checkups in the data. It just hadn't crossed my mind for that to be a variable but I was very interested to see it in the data.
