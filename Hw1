#I was actually very surprised to see that the results varied a lot for each of the variables. For example, for income, many reported that they had not been diagnosed with a depressive disorder, majority of those are shown to be in the middle-high class, with an income of between 50K-Less than 150K. This could be due to the fact that it contributes to less financial stress and thus a lower likelihood of a depressive disorder diagnosis. 
#For age, it was evenly distributed between the age ranges. Less people had reported to be diagnosed. however, ages 18-80 had all said yes and not one looked like they had more numbers than the other. however, in total, more poeple said no.
#For Education, majority of higher educaion and upperclassmen in high school (Grade 12 to College graduate) had said yes, but it was overall substantially less than the amount of students in total who had said no. I find it interesting that the age was so evenly distributed but for education, it was more older students who had reported yes. could it be that they have a better understanding of the diagnosis? or possibly seeked help themselves?
#Race was the most interesting because white people had the highest in both yes and no categories. I would infer two reasons: they have more resources for a diagnosis and they are more culturally accepting of mental health topics such as depression and overall welcome western medicine. All the others races included had said yes as well but a lot less compared to white people, probably because in each culture there exists a stigma around mental health medicine and diagnosis? thus being less diagnosis because many African Americans, asians, native,  american indians etc, don't have access to these resources for multiple reasons (ses, stigma, etx).
